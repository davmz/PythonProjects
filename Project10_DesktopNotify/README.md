If you want to run the program in the background, run the .pyw file. It will run the program. If you want to stop using the program, find Python with the clock.ico image located in "Background Processes". Right click on the program and click on "End Task".

clock.ico does not seem to work on the notification but it does seem to work on task manager and on your windows navigatio bar.
